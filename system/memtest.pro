;Procedure MEMTEST
;
; Syntax: memtest
;
; Purpose:
; This procedure was designed primarily to test the impacts of Windows OS
; memory fragmentation behavior on IDL memory allocation.
;
; The procedure attempts to allocate 10 coexisting memory blocks of 2 GB size.
; If there is not enough memory to accomplish this, it allocates the 10
; largest coexisting blocks that it can. It stops allocating new memory blocks
; either:
;
; - when it has allocated full 10 blocks.
; - when it cannot allocate any additional block of more than 1 MB in size
;   (i.e. when the application has run out of available memory).
;
; Postcondition:
; This program outputs a log of its successful allocations that may look like:
;
; Memory block # 1: 1168 Mb (total: 1168 Mb)
; Memory block # 2:  206 Mb (total: 1374 Mb)
; Memory block # 3:  143 Mb (total: 1517 Mb)
; Memory block # 4:  118 Mb (total: 1635 Mb)
; Memory block # 5:   79 Mb (total: 1714 Mb)
; Memory block # 6:   54 Mb (total: 1768 Mb)
; Memory block # 7:   41 Mb (total: 1809 Mb)
; Memory block # 8:   39 Mb (total: 1848 Mb)
; Memory block # 9:   31 Mb (total: 1879 Mb)
; Memory block #10:   16 Mb (total: 1895 Mb)
;
; (Note that the output may have fewer than 10 blocks of memory)
